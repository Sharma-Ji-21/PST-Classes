/*
Object Oriented Programming Style:
- Everything is driven by class and objects.
- Provide modularization.
- High Security
- Proper code management
# Pointer:
    A pointer is a concept where you can store the memory address of an object, allowing you to access or manipulate the object indirectly through its address.

Concepts for Opps: 
- AICOPE:
1. Abstraction : Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation (Unnessary) details and showing only the essential features of an object.(Example the Car engine is nessary to know but how the engine works is not nessary) 
Using abstract keyword.
2. Inheritance : Inheritance is the process of creating a new class from an existing class.(Just like generation works) Child class will be having the permetion to access the properties of parent class. We use extend keyword to perform inheritance.
3. Class : Blue print that contains objects and fields/variables.
4. Objects : Instance of Class.
5. Polymorphism : (Different behavior of the same person like facee among parents is Different that the face amoung the friends) when methods or other behave differently is different situation.(Class remains the same).
Compile time Overloading. Function name same but different parameter.
Compile time Overriding. Function name same and same parameter.
6. Encapsulation : Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the properties and methods within a single unit, like a medicine capsule, to restrict direct access to certain components and protect the integrity of the object.

Foure fundamental pillar of Opps:
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

    /*
     * inheritance :
    - Single inheritance: Single Parent
    - Multilevel inheritance: Sequence of Multiple Parent
    - Multiple inheritance: Extending Multiple Classes to Child Class.(Not Possible in Java By using Interfaces)
