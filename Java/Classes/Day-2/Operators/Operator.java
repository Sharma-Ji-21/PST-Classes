    Arithmetic Operators:
    + Addition=> Adds together two values  (x+y)	
    - Subtraction=> Subtracts one value from another  (x-y)	
    * Multiplication=> Multiplies two values  (x*y)	
    / Division=> Divides one value by another  (x/y)	
    % Modulus=> Returns the division remainder  (x%y)	
    ++ Increment=> Increases the value of a variable by 1  (++x)
    -- Decrement=> Decreases the value of a variable by 1  (--x)

    Assignment Operators:
    = Assignment=> Assigns a value to a variable  (x=y)
    += Addition Assignment=> Adds together two values  (x+=y)
    -= Subtraction Assignment=> Subtracts one value from another  (x-=y)
    *= Multiplication Assignment=> Multiplies two values  (x*=y)
    /= Division Assignment=> Divides one value by another  (x/=y)
    %= Modulus Assignment=> Returns the division remainder  (x%=y)

    Comparison Operators:
    == Equality=> Checks if two values are equal  (x==y)
    != Not Equal=> Checks if two values are not equal  (x!=y)
    > Greater Than=> Checks if one value is greater than another  (x>y)
    < Less han=> Checks if one value is less than another  (x<y)
    >= GreaterThanOrEqualTo=> Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another  (x>=y)
    <= LessThanOrEqualTo=> Checks if one value is less than or equal to another  (x<=y)

    Logical Operators:
    && Logical And=> Checks if two conditions are true  (x&&y)
    || Logical Or=> Checks if one condition is true  (x||y)
    ! Logical Not=> Reverses the result of a condition  (!x)

    Bitwise Operators:
    & Bitwise And=> Returns the bitwise AND of two numbers  (x&y)
    | Bitwise Or=> Returns the bitwise OR of two numbers  (x|y)
    ^ Bitwise XOR=> Returns the bitwise XOR of two numbers  (x^y)
    ~ Bitwise Not=> Returns the bitwise NOT of a number  (~x)

    Ternary Operator:
    ? : Ternary Operator=> Returns a value based on a condition  
    (condition ? value1 : value2)
    value1=> True;
    value2=> False;
