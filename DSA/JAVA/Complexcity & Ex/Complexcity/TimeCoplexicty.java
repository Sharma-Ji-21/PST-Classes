Best case: You got exactly what you wanted.
Average case: You got something slightly different from what you wanted.
Worst case: You got the complete opposite of what you wanted.


O(n) -  The algorithm's time scales directly with the input size.

O(n^2) - The time taken increases quadratically as the input size grows. Common in algorithms with nested loops.

O(n^3) - The time taken increases cubically as the input size grows.

O(log(n)) - The algorithm reduces the input size by a logarithmic factor (like half) at each step. The number of steps required grows linearly with the input size.

O(log (log(n))) - The input size decreases hyper-exponentially, like squaring or cubing the size reduction each time.
