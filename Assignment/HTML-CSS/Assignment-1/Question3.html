<!-- Question 3: Company Profile Page
Create a company profile page by following these steps:
Use an <h1> element for the company name.
For the mission statement, use an <h2> element followed by a <p> element containing the 
mission. Inside the <p>, use the <strong> element to emphasize important parts of the 
mission.
Create a "Core Values" section using an <h3> element. For each core value, use separate 
<p> elements and use the <strong> element to emphasize key values.
Include an "Awards" section with an <h3> element. List the awards received with a brief 
description in regular text.
Add an example of nested elements within a <p> element somewhere on the page. This could 
be a combination of <strong>, <em>, or <i> elements nested together to enhance meaning. -->
