        <p>
            You're 17 years old and studying at 
            PST Polaris School of Technology in 
            Bangalore. You enjoy learning 
            JavaScript and have tackled various 
            topics like functions, operators, and 
            asynchronous programming. You've 
            completed projects like a calculator 
            and a Money Splitter app, and you're 
            currently working on the snail 
            problem. You live in a hostel with 
            your roommate, Yug Ramoliya. 
            Additionally, you prefer a 
            dark-themed design for your projects 
            and like to add emojis to make them 
            more attractive!
