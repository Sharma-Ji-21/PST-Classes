<a> Link (Anchor Tag)=>  The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the
<a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link’s destination. This attribute determines where the user is
directed upon clicking the link.

Unvisited links: Underlined and blue.
Visited links: Underlined and purple.
Active links: Underlined and red.

Relative Links: (accessing other html files)
Relative links are used to link pages within the same website. They are based on the
structure of your website’s directories, making them flexible and portable as the
website moves between different domains or servers.
